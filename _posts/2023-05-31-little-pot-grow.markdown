Greetings, my sunshines.

Golly! It is now the end of May.

I wanted to post something before June comes in about <3 hours from now.

Why don't we start off with some much anticipated [Scribble Diffusion](https://scribblediffusion.com/) pieces?

*"Be not afraid,"* says the Angel of Pine, *"for my saplings shall surely rise."* &#128519;

And another one...

It is I, rising from my dormancy.

Also, this one reminds me of the art style of Rita Angus and Byzantine art.

Oh! What have *I* been up to? You ask?

Numbers. Lots of numbers, I must say.

OH! Great news! I finally figured out the name of that mysterious plant from my earlier [post]({% post_url 2023-03-12-saddle-point %}).

The name of this plant is... Bromeliad!!

In fact, our dearly beloved *Ananas comosus*, is of the same family [*Bromeliaceae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromeliaceae), or the Bromeliads!!

Got one of them from my local plant store.

Beautiful! Viva, *Ananas comosus*! &#127821;

But also, I have been painting little pots - a great unwind surprise from my dearly beloved friend - &#128153; you, my dear.

Behold, our cute little painted pots (+ cacti &#127797;)!!

My dear friend painted the one on the left with the blue flowers~ &#127804;.

Yours truly painted the one on the right which looks oddly familiar to a particular much adored fruit... &#127821;

Truly, it is a wonderful feeling to feel the genuine love and kindness of a friend.

It is sweet - like a pineapple~!! &#127821; &#128155;

> "Anxiety weighs down the heart, but a kind word cheers it up." - Proverbs 12:25 (NIV)

Wish me the best for when my knowledge of numbers is put to the test (very soon).

Where is June? There she is!!

Until next time, my sunshines.

As always, stay fresh~ &#128526;
