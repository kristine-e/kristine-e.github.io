*Good* Good Friday, folks.

Wow!! It's been almost a month since my last post. Oh, time, where did you go?

Now, it is, what I like to call, the season of the eggs. &#129370;

Speaking of eggs. My lovely dear friend [&#127775;](https://theauspicioussuitcase.tumblr.com/) gave me some chocolate eggs + a bunny!!

The pineapple was also from the same friend from an earlier time. Thank you, my dear &#128155;.

Ahh, as always, behold, my latest from [Scribble Diffusion](https://scribblediffusion.com/)...

Okay, so the first one was, sort of, meant to be my *pine-sona*, of some sorts.

Hmm, not entirely sure how I feel about it but it's definitely cute~ &#129402;!!

The second one features my other fascination: bunnies. How fitting for the season!! &#127821; &#128007;

A.I., am I right? &#128512; So fascinating!!

Recently, I heard that there is a company in Vietnam that is turning pineapple scraps into soap!!

What a fantastic and environmentally-conscious innovation!!

And also, what a loving and super sweet gesture for someone you &#128155;.

My friends, may you all receive much &#128155; and why not give a little &#128155; yourself during this season of the eggs. &#129370;

With that, I must go, for the pineapples call my name.

Until next time, happy Easter, my sweets~ &#127821;.
