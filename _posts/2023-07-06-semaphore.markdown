Good day, sunshines~

I am pleased to advise that I have passed the second half of my numbers trials. Hallelujah~ &#128519;!!

As I take a pause from the trials, I have been trying something a bit different.

Of course, I sought more knowledge of our favourite golden fruit. &#127821;

This time, I have decided to explore the art of words and thus did some research to find some pineapple-related words and fun facts.

Behold, I have written some poetry. Specifically, of the haiku form.

Here they are, enjoy the party... &#127881;


### Unripe ###

> This poem is about a pineapple that was harvested too early from the shrub. Generally, the slightly-softer and yellow-er a pineapple is, the more ripe it is. When they are picked too early, they are unlikely to ripen [(Delany, 2018)](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-tell-if-a-pineapple-is-ripe).
>
> Instead of lamenting its timing, it looks forward as it returns to the soil to give other pineapples the chance it was not given to ripen.

*Still tough yet was plucked,*

*Barely-yellow, mostly-green,*

*To ripe another.*

### Pine-ometry ###

> This is a poem written to appreciate the mathematical properties of the pineapple.

*Helical[^1] fusions*

*Of gold hexagonal eyes[^2]*

*Form Fibonacci[^1].*

[^1]: The pineapple fruit “is usually arranged in two interlocking helices, often with 8 in one direction and 13 in the other, each being a Fibonacci number” [(Wikipedia contributors, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pineapple&oldid=1159558381).

[^2]:	From Philippine folklore, the pineapple is said to have many eyes after the story of a mother who was frustrated with her daughter who played instead of helping her cook when she had fallen sick - using the excuse that she could not find what her mother asked of her to look for - wished that her daughter had *a thousand eyes* so that she could find what she was looking for. &#128064;
	
	After the mother had made this wish, her daughter was nowhere to be found. Then the mother saw a pineapple in her garden where her daughter loved to play in, she named the fruit *Pina* (fun fact: *Piña* means *Pineapple* in Tagalog) after her daughter [(Vijayendra, 2019)](http://folklore.usc.edu/why-pineapples-have-eyes-filipino-legend/).


### Fizz buzz! ###

> This poem is about the stinging sensation one gets upon taking a bite of a sweet pineapple fruit.

*The sweet aroma*

*Of the sun pie calls, a bite…*

*Fizz buzz! Chills thy tongue.*

Poetry sure is fun! &#128524;

That is all I have to say.

Until next time, pines~
