Howdy do! This is Kristine, I am not really an actual pineapple farmer in the sense that I grow pineapples, but I am one who is very fascinated by the Ananas comosus.

However, though I do have an affinity for the typical yellow fruit, I feel that there is much I still do not know about them. Hence, I have allocated this space of the internet to document my discoveries to build my awareness of what the universe knows about the pineapple so far.

Yes, I am new to all this. It is not every day that one decides to document their journey to learn more about the fruit they have come to love. Alas, that shall not stop this determined farmer of knowledge!!

With the power of internet and by the sweet divine, we shall find out together, more about this humble fruit they call the pineapple.

The first thing that I must figure out is how to make this space a bit more comfortable for my pineapples.

Stay tuned for more, my sweet sunshines.
