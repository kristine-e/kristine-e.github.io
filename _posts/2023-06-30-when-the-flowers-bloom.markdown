Greetings, my fine pines~

Yes, I have made it back from the trial(s) of numbers.

Did I pass the trials?

As far as I know at this time, I have passed half of them.

[\**sound of applause*\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gyu82WG_edM) &#128079; &#129346; &#127881;

Let us hope for the best for the other half, shall we? &#128591;

On to slightly more interesting things...

This time, I have decided to do something more traditional in terms of art work.

Behold, my latest masterpiece... the pineapple fairy, *Pinelemona P. Pine*.

(The *P* in the middle stands for *Pineapple*, of course.)

Beautiful, is she not?  &#127821; &#128519; &#127803; &#128155;

My dear Pinelemona was sketched and coloured using the amazing **free** open-source painting program [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).

Her favourite colour is <span style="color: pink">**pink**</span>, she is fond of plants and all things nature, and she has some adorable little friends.

A snow white bunny named *Ruth*, like the biblical Ruth because of her soft heart. &#128007;

And a cheeky grey tabby kitty named *White Socks*, because of his white socks. &#128008;

There is also an orange-green butterfly that hangs around which calls themselves *Raystar*. &#129419;

And a fluttery energetic blue hummingbird named *Esther* because of their strong spirit. &#128038;

Yes, I have made quite the narrative, haven't I? More lore to come... (?).

Aside from my dabble into the art world, my eye caught sight of something very pine-y recently.

Here it is...

It's a pineapple wearing goggles!!

The name of this adorable surfer-swimmer pine is *Maui*. Very cool~ &#128526; &#127754;.

Welcome, cool Maui, to the home of the *Ananas comosus*!

And lately, I have been thinking about growth. &#127793;

As a pineapple-enthusiast, I wonder every now and then what to do with this life time.

My knowledge of the pines and numbers grows daily, bit-by-bit, but sometimes my mind stagnates.

Then, I realised the value of a true rest, not the half-baked kind, but really just a dedicated time to empty the mind and think of nothing.

Everyone needs time to grow. Like seeds, one needs soil, water, sunshine, and of course, time. &#128337; &#128167;

Flik the ant from one of my beloved childhood movies *A Bug's Life* best explains this analogy with a rock &#129704; &#128028;...

Growth takes time. And I think that is true for humans as much as it is for pineapples.

After all, *after the storm is when the flowers bloom*. &#127803; &#127801; &#127804; &#127800;

And here is my anthurium, just about to bloom...

As June fades away, I hope all of you get some time to rest this mid-year. &#9728;

Much sweet sunshine to you all, my fellow pines.
