Kumusta, my fellow pines!! &#128522;

Yes, it is I, still standing.

Firstly, I came across this beauty at a friend's garden that I must simply share for the love of pineapples.

Beautiful, ain't it? &#129402; Two of my favourite things: the colour pink & pineapples.

However, I am unfamiliar with the name of this plant. &#129300; Hmmm... a mystery to solve!! Exciting. I shall investigate further into the name of this beauty. Will update you all later on a future pine-ing.

Although... if anyone happens to come across my little space on the internet for my pine-fatuations *and* happens to know the name of this plant, please let me know by sending me an email riiight [here](mailto:kristinespineapplefarm@gmail.com).

Gracias in advance!! &#128519;

Though it is a *tiny* probability, it is a probability nevertheless.

Hopeful; I shall remain. &#128524;

Otherwise, so far, I have been enjoying my number adventures.

Recently, I learned of something called a *Saddle point*. A point on a 3-dimensional surface that is neither a maximum nor a minimum. Fascinating!! &#128522;

Immediately, I thought of pineapples. Thus, it served as the inspiration for my latest [Scribble Diffusion](https://scribblediffusion.com/) creation.

Behold, the Pineapple Saddle point!!

Perhaps, one of my favourites so far. The soft pastel yellow simply oozes of sunshine!! &#x1f31e;

Doodling; one of life's greatest pastimes.

Alas, I have not been able to doodle much other than functions like these...

Algebraic multi-variable adventures!! There sure is a lot to learn but I believe it can all be learned.

My friends, no matter how tough things may look right now, like the skin of a pineapple, with effort, perseverence, hope, and a little love, underneath all that struggle that you had to get through, is something tasty, sweet, delicious, absolutely wonderful, and worth it all.

As always, stay fresh~
