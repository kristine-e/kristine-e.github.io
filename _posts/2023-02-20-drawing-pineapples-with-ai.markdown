Hello again, sunshines!!

So, I've been messing around with this cool web app called [Scribble Diffusion](https://scribblediffusion.com/).

It uses artificial intelligence (or A.I.) to transform drawings into more refined images. Pretty neat, huh?

As you all know, I love pineapples! So, I tried sketching some of them.

The results? Quite surprising... in a good way, I must say!!

Here are some of my experimentations.

So fun!! Pineapples are beautiful in every form.

That's all for today, my sweets.

Take care, my sunshines!!
