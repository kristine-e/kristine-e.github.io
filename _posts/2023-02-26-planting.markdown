Hello again, my sweets!!

Behold, my latest creations from [Scribble Diffusion](https://scribblediffusion.com/).

Drum roll please.

TA DA!!

Have no fear, our dear pineapple made it out alive. In fact, they became friends!!

It all turned out to be a misunderstanding. The larger pine simply wanted to befriend the smaller pine, not eat it!!

I find this quotation from Martin Luther King, Jr. says it best.

> "Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend." - Martin Luther King, Jr.

Mabuhay friendship!! &#128155; Mabuhay *Ananas comosus*!! &#127821;

Actually, I am here to tell you that it might be a while till my next update as I will be expanding whatever is left of my cranium with yet more numbers. One can never have too many numbers in their life. &#128526;

In short, I am returning to study maths and stats. BEAUTIFUL. Numbers; the language of pineapples.

Worry not!! For I shall strive to come back with more discoveries in the midst of my number adventures.

Let us think of this as a way of... planting? Yes, let's go with that.

As my former supervisor would say, "pray for miracles, but plant cabbages".

As this is a home for the *Ananas comosus*, let us all *plant* pineapples. One seed at a time.

> "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble." - Matthew 6:34 (NKJV)

Take it easy, sunshines!!

Stay fresh, my sweets.
