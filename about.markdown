Hi! I'm Kristine.

How do I introduce myself? I exist, I guess.

I don't actually grow pineapples like a regular farmer. Rather, I like to think of myself as a farmer of knowledge.

Knowledge of the fruit that the scientific world have deemed to be called the *Ananas comosus* - or that we, the general population, have come to know as the Pineapple.

Yes, my friends. I am obsessed with this fruit.

And thus, my love for the sweet sunshine fruit has lead me to explore further what we know about it.

My memory is not the sharpest so I have arranged a space on the internet to keep record of my findings.

We, at Kristine's pineapple farm, hope you enjoy your stay and learn more about pineapples every day!!
